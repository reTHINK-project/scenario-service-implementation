Group Chat Hyperty
------------------

### Architecture

*Describe main Hyperty functionalities, Hyperty type and scenarios where the Hyperty will be used. Describe main internal Hyperty component architecture with a class diagram.*

The Group Chat main functionality is to handle Text conversations among groups.

### Hyperty Data Objects schemas

*Identify reTHINK standardised data object schemas or Specify new Data Object schemas handled by the Hyperty*

This Hyperty handles standard [Communication Data Objects](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/tree/master/docs/datamodel/connection) extended for Chat Communications:

![Group Chat Data Model](group-chat-data-model.png)

Each message is a SyncDataChild object with the URL comm:\\<hyperty-creator-domain>\<chatId>\child\<participantId>\<chatMsgId>

The Hyperty author is the reporter off the Chat Message and all other Group Chat Hyperty participants are observers.

*Specify Hyperty API to be consumed by the Application*

The Group Chat Hyperty implements two Hyperty APIs:

#### Hyperty Group Chat Manager API

The Hyperty Group Chat Manager API is used to manage new Chat Group conversations.

### Main data flows

*Use MSCs to describe how the Application can use the Hyperty API for the main use cases supported by the Hyperty. Mapping between the Hyperty API functions and the Hyperty Framework functions including the Data Object handling should be depicted in separated in Diagrams*
