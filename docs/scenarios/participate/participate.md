----------------------------------

###Scenario Environment


*Describe Actors involved in the scenario using Business Roles defined in D1.1 and D2.1, Business relationships and Business models/ecosystems defined in D1.1. Define Devices to be used including end-user devices like browser and smartphone as well as M2M/IoT devices like sensors and atuators. Provide a picture to illustrate the scenario environment*


This [figure](reThink_participate_use_case.png) provides a UML Use Case view of the participate umbrella use case.

###User perspective


*Textual description of the scenario including the main use cases to be supported. Refer as much as possible to use cases defined in D1.1.*
Imagine the reThink app “Participate” to be our cooperate unique framework for the realization off various different use cases. The basic structure is as simple as possible. An input field provides the possibility to enter natural speech based search items for the search of conversational partners in the internet, when no address book entry is available. Most of the rest of space is occupied by tabs, each of them representing a specific context.  A context, represented by a tab, might be just a traditional address book but also the football group as example for a neighborhood scenario, a smart controller for your hotel room or a eGovernment environment. Tabs can be created, downloaded or deleted. They might be deleted, they might be temporary or persistent or might be activated or deactivated. 


#### Identity Management and Trust from user perspective

*Textual description of Identity Management and Trust aspects from User Perspective*

#### Interoperability from user perspective

*Textual description of interoperability involving the usage of Apps delivered from different Testbed e.g. Audio Call between a Conversation App from DT and a Conversation App from PT*

###Required reTHINK Framework Functionalities

*Detailed analysis of required funcionalities, interfaces and data schemas as specified in D2.2, D3.1 and D4.1. Highlight missing functionalities*

###Required Testbed features


*Identify features required from Testbed operators including Public IPs, number of Docker images/Servers and its characteristics, ports to be opened, .. Use a Network diagram.*

Note that so far only one test bed operator has specified available components [see issues](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/testbeds/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+Constraints+of+Test+Bed+Operators+).  If you sepcify any requirements in access of the specified available components, you might face the situation that the use case might not be run on a available testbed.

###Required Hyperties


*identify required Hyperties, its main functionalities and associated data schemas. Use a graphical language to describe hyperties composition and relationships (to be defined)*
