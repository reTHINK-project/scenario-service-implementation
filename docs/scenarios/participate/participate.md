###Scenario Environment


*Describe Actors involved in the scenario using Business Roles defined in D1.1 and D2.1, Business relationships and Business models/ecosystems defined in D1.1. Define Devices to be used including end-user devices like browser and smartphone as well as M2M/IoT devices like sensors and atuators. Provide a picture to illustrate the scenario environment*


This [figure](reThink_participate_use_case.png) provides a UML Use Case view of the participate umbrella use case.

###User perspective


*Textual description of the scenario including the main use cases to be supported. Refer as much as possible to use cases defined in D1.1.*

#### Identity Management and Trust from user perspective

*Textual description of Identity Management and Trust aspects from User Perspective*

#### Interoperability from user perspective

*Textual description of interoperability involving the usage of Apps delivered from different Testbed e.g. Audio Call between a Conversation App from DT and a Conversation App from PT*

###Required reTHINK Framework Functionalities

*Detailed analysis of required funcionalities, interfaces and data schemas as specified in D2.2, D3.1 and D4.1. Highlight missing functionalities*

###Required Testbed features


*Identify features required from Testbed operators including Public IPs, number of Docker images/Servers and its characteristics, ports to be opened, .. Use a Network diagram.*

Note that so far only one test bed operator has specified available components [see issues](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/testbeds/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+Constraints+of+Test+Bed+Operators+).  If you sepcify any requirements in access of the specified available components, you might face the situation that the use case might not be run on a available testbed.

###Required Hyperties


*identify required Hyperties, its main functionalities and associated data schemas. Use a graphical language to describe hyperties composition and relationships (to be defined)*
