###Scenario Environment

*Describe Actors involved in the scenario using Business Roles defined in D1.1 and D2.1, Business relationships and Business models/ecosystems defined in D1.1. Define Devices to be used including end-user devices like browser and smartphone as well as M2M/IoT devices like sensors and atuators. Provide a picture to illustrate the scenario environment*

The _My City User Scenario_ represents the daily life in a smart city, named Bersabon.
Deliverable D1.1 describes the scenario as follows:

>Going through her daily life, Alice is collecting data on her smartphone, e.g. by  locally storing locations she frequently visits, from sensors she retrieves information from or including news websites which inform her about the latest movies with her favorite actor. Her service provider makes suggestions on the basis of these collected data, e.g. she is recommended a cinema she hasn’t been before,  that plays a movie with her favorite . Before going to the movies, Alice is also recommended a new restaurant that offers a special opening promotion. A week later, she is going downtown, and runs into a large crowd that seems to be looking at something. Her smartphone vibrates and notifies her about a new message by someone in the vicinity. She opens the group chat that automatically formed and sees a picture someone has taken and posted to the group: It seems to be from the center of the crowd, there is a street performer. Alice takes part in the conversation pseudonymously. On her way back home, she sees a note on the highest tree of her neighborhood. On it, there is a QR-code. She scans it with her smartphone and enters a group discussion about the removal of the tree.


###User perspective


*Textual description of the scenario including the main use cases to be supported. Refer as much as possible to use cases defined in D1.1.*

#### Identity Management and Trust from user perspective

*Textual description of Identity Management and Trust aspects from User Perspective*

#### Interoperability from user perspective

*Textual description of interoperability involving the usage of Apps delivered from different Testbed e.g. Audio Call between a Conversation App from DT and a Conversation App from PT*

###Required reTHINK Framework Functionalities

*Detailed analysis of required funcionalities, interfaces and data schemas as specified in D2.2, D3.1 and D4.1. Highlight missing functionalities*

###Required Testbed features


*Identify features required from Testbed operators including Public IPs, number of Docker images/Servers and its characteristics, ports to be opened, .. Use a Network diagram.*

Note that so far only one test bed operator has specified available components [see issues](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/testbeds/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+Constraints+of+Test+Bed+Operators+).  If you sepcify any requirements in access of the specified available components, you might face the situation that the use case might not be run on a available testbed.

###Required Hyperties


*identify required Hyperties, its main functionalities and associated data schemas. Use a graphical language to describe hyperties composition and relationships (to be defined)*
