Daily Life in a Smart City
----------------------------------

###Scenario Environment

*xxx*

###User perspective

Going through her daily life, Alice is collecting data on her smartphone, e.g. by  locally storing locations she frequently visits, from sensors she retrieves information from or including news websites which inform her about the latest movies with her favorite actor. The process of acquiring data from sensors and webservices is visualized in Figure 1.
 
Alice moves to a new city and queries her service provider for a recommendation on what to do in the new city, see Figure 2. Based on her profile data, she is recommended a social event that takes place in the evening. (Associated use case: #72 Recommendation by service provider based on context and preference)
 
At the event, the smartphones of the attending users are used to transmit some of their profile information to a server or service that is connected to a large display at the event. On this display, the profile pictures of the attending guests are shown (see Figure 3). (Associated use case: #80 Ad-hoc community)
 
The event host is broadcasting announcements to the attending event guests (Figure 4), for example information about the buffet or vouchers for drinks at the bar at bigger events. (Associated use case: #14 Ad-hoc group massaging)
 
On her smartphone, Alice looks through the list of attendees (Figure 5). Bob strikes her interest: Alice is interested to meet someone who knows the city’s restaurant scene. In Bob’s profile, Alice can see that he is a chef. Additionally, the music taste is indicated as similar to that of Alice. Bob decided to share his birthday only with his friends, so Alice cannot see it yet. Alice to go find Bob at the party. (Associated use case: #15 Retrieving public information from nearby people)
 
Alice starts a conversation with Bob. After becoming friends, Alice can see his whole profile. They talk about the music they like and the restaurant scene in the city. Bob knows the restaurants in the city and can recommend one to Alice. For other things like sports, Alice and Bob are not that similar, but Alice can query Bob in order to use his connections to other people to retrieve further recommendations (see Figure 6). (Associated use case: #71 Recommendation by friend)

#### Interoperability from user perspective

*Textual description of interoperability involving the usage of Apps delivered from different Testbed e.g. Audio Call between a Conversation App from DT and a Conversation App from PT*

###Required reTHINK Framework Functionalities

*Detailed analysis of required funcionalities, interfaces and data schemas as specified in D2.2, D3.1 and D4.1. Highlight missing functionalities*

###Required Testbed features


*Identify features required from Testbed operators including Public IPs, number of Docker images/Servers and its characteristics, ports to be opened, .. Use a Network diagram.*

Note that so far only one test bed operator has specified available components [see issues](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/testbeds/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+Constraints+of+Test+Bed+Operators+).  If you sepcify any requirements in access of the specified available components, you might face the situation that the use case might not be run on a available testbed.

###Required Hyperties


*identify required Hyperties, its main functionalities and associated data schemas. Use a graphical language to describe hyperties composition and relationships (to be defined)*
