## 3.6  Hotel Guest Room Monitor & Control (FOKUS)	

The design and functional decompostition of the Room Monitor and Control Hyperty as well as the Hotel Connectivity Hyperty is unchanged as per described in deliverable D5.1 Revision 1. Phase II of reTHINK implemented the attachment to the connectivity adapter to the Last Hop Connectivity Broker in order to control the end device's network interface and configure it to connect to the password-protected WiFi network of the hotel.  The following pictures recap the components for each of the two hyperties.
