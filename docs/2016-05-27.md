__We encourage all WP5 partners to provide first versions of the implementations to collect all the feedback generated by the developer during the programming tasks. Finally we decided to add this feedback as issues in the [scenario-service-implementation](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/scenario-service-implementation) with label "improvement/enhancement"__ .
