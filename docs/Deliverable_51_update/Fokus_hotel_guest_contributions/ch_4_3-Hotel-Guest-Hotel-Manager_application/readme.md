## 4.3 Hotel Guest & Hotel Manager application 


**Content from D5.1 below;  Needs major update as we merged both in one applicaiton**

4.2	Hotel Guest Application
The Hotel Guest application will allow a person to book a room with specific gadgets included by selecting which sensors or actuators to have control on from the list of available devices at a specific hotel. The booking confirmation will be received by the application. On checkin, the hotel guest can authenticate and download the Hotel Connectivity and Room Monitor and Control hyperties. If the guest wants to be able to perform online checkout, it was to give the credit card on checkin. Payment will be done asynchronously after the room is checked by the hotel administrator (e.g. if the minibar was used). The Hotel guest application menu will be available to the user as in Figure 60.

The administrator application will use the Room Monitor and control hyperty to monitor sensor readings and actuate. By using the Smart Device Configuration Bootstrap the administrator will be able to manage device connectivity, specifically the device ownership, seeFigure 61.
