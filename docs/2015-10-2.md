#Minutes:
We based the discussion on these two documents:
https://github.com/reTHINK-project/scenario-service-implementation/tree/master/docs/scenarios

https://github.com/reTHINK-project/scenario-service-implementation/issues/1

We have to define the scope of the scenarios description for the D5.1 and the details for phase I.
It is necessary to provide the detailed specification of the scenarios, at least for the phase I.
We have to deal with the short time lapse between the results for phase I in WP3 (M14) and the results for phase I in WP5 (M17).

#Action points:
- Paulo wll provide a more detailed structure of the scenarios description next week.
- Yudani will provide a proposal of the Table of Content for the D5.1

Weekly telcos: Friday at 12h (CET)

#Participants:
Fraunhofer: Marc
PT: Paulo
