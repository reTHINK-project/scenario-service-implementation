Daily life in a smart city â€“ Individual contextual services

Bersabon has a local police department designed to help local citizens and visitor in different areas (traffic, etc). Citizens and local government use "Participate" as a tool to exchange ideas, suggestions, etc. 

In case of difficulties, the police department can send notifications to users of Participate based on location, i.e. drivers closed to a traffic jam or participants in a public demonstration. Users of Participate can join ad-hoc group chats to discuss hot topics (local exhibitions, discussion groups, events, etc). Depending on the type of group this might allow audio, video, chat, etc. Some groups will be only available for users connected from a specific location, others will be accesible in an anonymous way. Local officers will have rights to retrieve public information of users in case of emergency, including the possibility to have a p2p conversation. 

In addition, Participate will store your preferences and searches to send notifications of events of your interest, i.e. imagine you were searching for musicals and you were attending some in the last year so you can receive information of next musicals. In Participate you can access to feedback and recommendations from other users that could be useful.
